# RS-232 Serial Port General Reader

A rust app made to read any RS - 232 data specifically for Arduino and sensors connected to them to reduce the number of apps needed and make the one app really good

## How to Use

*idk because its not even close to done*

## How it Works

It doesn't lmao

## Issues Currently Being Fixed

1. **Fix slowdown with large values (2<sup>31</sup>)**
1. fix graphing latency / optimize with 40000+ data points *goes longer with -r on*

## Future Issues

1. go from time based update to waiting based updates for the graph and move that to the port
1. figure out how to deal with different types of data from ports
