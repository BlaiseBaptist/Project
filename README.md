# RS-232 Serial Port Reader

A rust app made to read any RS - 232 data specifically for Arduino and sensors connected to them.

## How to use

### Code Side
    
    idk just like press the buttons 

### Arduino Side
    
    can be more tricky because arduinos dont like to behave use 'Serial.write((byte)&var,4)' to write var so the code can read it
